# Mastering PHP Design Patterns

Mastering PHP Design Patterns by Packt. It contains all the supporting project
files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## Instructions and Navigation

This is the code repository for
[Mastering PHP Design Patterns][mastering-php-design-patterns], published by Packt.

There are no additional code bundle for the following chapters:

- **Chapter 8** - SOLID Principles
- **Chapter 9** - The Road to Enterprise Application

Chapter 8 is mainly about explaining SOLID principles, so the code bundles are
about concepts without actual implementation. Chapter 9 is about a workflow and
related configurations, so it is rather trivial to put them as code bundles
into files.


## Description

Mastering PHP Design Patterns goes beyond traditional design patterns as envisaged by the Gang of Four and details the practices that passionate PHP developers need to be successful as software engineers or leads on detailed PHP projects. 
This book will introduce you to the core knowledge required to understand project management techniques, why the majority software development projects fail, and why you can make yours a success.
